== In the beginning there was Vert.x

You can't do much in Vert.x-land unless you can communicate with a {@link io.vertx.core.Vertx} object!

It's the control centre of Vert.x and is how you do pretty much everything, including creating clients and servers,
getting a reference to the event bus, setting timers, as well as many other things.

So how do you get an instance?

When you start your application with the CLI, a `$vertx` variable will be made available to your code.

[source,ruby]
----
server = $vertx.create_http_server # <1>
server.request_handler { |request|
  request.response.end("Hello world")
}
server.listen(8080)
----
<1> At runtime, `vertx` variable is available

Then run the applicaton with the CLI:

[source,bash]
----
vertx run my-verticle.rb
----

NOTE: Most applications will only need a single Vert.x instance, but it's possible to create multiple Vert.x instances if you
require, for example, isolation between the event bus or different groups of servers and clients.

=== Specifying options when creating a Vertx object

When creating a Vert.x object you can also specify options if the defaults aren't right for you.

[source,bash]
----
vertx run my-verticle.rb -options my-options.json
----

If you want to increase the worker pool size, your `my-options.json` file may look like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "workerPoolSize": 40
}
----

The {@link io.vertx.core.VertxOptions} object has many settings and allows you to configure things like clustering, high availability, pool sizes and various other settings.

=== Creating a clustered Vert.x object

If you're creating a *clustered Vert.x* (See the section on the <<event_bus, event bus>> for more information on clustering the event bus), add the `-cluster` option:

[source,bash]
----
vertx run my-verticle.rb -cluster
----
