=== Writing Verticles

Ruby verticles are implemented as simple scripts.

Ruby verticles will have the following globals pre-set as a convenience:

* +$vertx+ - A reference to the Vertx object

[source,ruby]
----
# Start a timer
$vertx.set_periodic(1000) { puts 'Timer has fired' }
----

When the verticle is deployed the body of the script will be executed.

Any `vertx_start` function function defined during the body execution will be executed after the
execution. The `vertx_start` is executed as any other function and does not expect any argument.

Likewise any `vertx_stop` function function defined during the body execution will be executed after the
execution. The `vertx_stop` is executed as any other function and does not expect any argument.

[source,ruby]
----
def vertx_stop future
  # Cleanup here
end
----

To load a verticle as a Ruby gem, this Ruby gem must deployed

=== Asynchronous Verticle start and stop

Sometimes you want to do something in your verticle start-up which takes some time and you don't want the verticle to
be considered deployed until that happens. For example you might want to deploy other verticles in the start method.

You can't block waiting for the other verticles to deploy in your start method as that would break the Golden Rule.

So how can you do this?

The way to do it is to implement theasynchronous* start method. This version of the method takes a Future as a parameter.
When the method returns the verticle willnot* be considered deployed yet. Some time later, after you've done everything
you need to do (e.g. start other verticles), you can call complete on the Future (or fail) to signal that you're done.

Here's an example:

[source,ruby]
----
def vertx_start_async start_future
  # Now deploy some other verticle:

  $vertx.deploy_verticle("other_verticle.rb") do |res|
    if res.succeeded?
      start_future.complete
    else
      start_future.fail
    end
  end
end
----

Similarly, there is an asynchronous version of the stop method too. You use this if you want to do some verticle
cleanup that takes some time.

[source,ruby]
----
def vertx_stop_async stop_future
  obj.do_something_that_takes_time do |res|
    if res.succeeded?
      stop_future.complete
    else
      stop_future.fail
    end
  end
end
----

INFO: You don't need to manually undeploy child verticles started by a verticle, in the verticle's stop method. Vert.x
will automatically undeploy any child verticles when the parent is undeployed.

=== Verticle deployment options

When deploying a Ruby, verticle it is possible to set a specific _GEM_PATH_ variable for this particular
verticle:

[source,java]
----
DeploymentOptions options = new DeploymentOptions().
    setConfig(new JsonObject().put("GEM_PATH", "/path/to/gems"));
vertx.deployVerticle("my_verticle.rb", options);
----

This can be done also possible in Ruby:

[source,ruby]
----
options = { config: { GEM_PATH: '/path/to/gems' } }
$vertx.deploy_verticle('my_verticle.rb', options)
----

This option can also be specified for the CLI:

----
vertx run my_verticle_rb -conf '{"GEM_PATH":"/path/to/gems"}'
----
